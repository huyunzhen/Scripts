Create C:\Temp\CTX and copy the following files:
Get-CTXUsers.ps1
get-fileinfo.ps1
psexec_command.txt
Replace-Text.ps1
run order.txt
Sort-Unique.ps1
update-dsn.ps1
updatedsn.bat

then run in order from powershell

cd c:\temp\ctx

.\get-ctxusers.ps1
	-> exports all applications with the application name, who has access, and what server it is published on (1 server/line)
	-> copy just the servers into list.txt

.\sort-unique.ps1
	-> outputs all unique (non-duplicate) server names into sorted.txt

.\get-fileinfo.ps1 sorted.txt "c:\Program Files\Citrix\Independent Management Architecture\MF20.dsn" "SERVER="
	-> returns what db each server is connecting to
	-> copy only the servers that are pointing to the db needing updated to update.txt

.\replace-text.ps1 update.txt "c:\Program Files\Citrix\Independent Management Architecture\MF20.dsn" "psql01_XP_EU_Farm" "SERVER=" "Address="
	-> performs the following on each server and creates Replace-Text.log
	-> creates a backup of "c:\Program Files\Citrix\Independent Management Architecture\MF20.dsn" as "MF20%DATE%.bak"
	-> searches the backup for "SERVER=" and "Address="
	-> replaces text in found lines after the search string with "psql01_XP_EU_Farm"

psexec_command.txt (run command line manually) "psexec @update.txt -c -f updatedsn.bat -w C:\Temp updatedsn.bat > updatedsn.log"
	-> connects to each server in update.txt
	-> copies "updatedsn.bat" to the remote server
	-> sets the remote working directory to "C:\Temp"
	-> executes "c:\temp\updatedsn.bat" on the remote server

	updatedsn.bat
		-> causes citrix to look at the DSN file updated by replace-text.ps1
		-> sets the "IMAService" to "manual" to keep ITO from attempting to restart it
		-> stops the "IMAService"
		-> waits 30 seconds
		-> recreates the Citrix Local Host Cache
		-> resets the "IMAService" to "auto"
		-> starts the "IMAServices"
		-> pauses to see all results

	-> logs screen output to updatedsn.log

.\check-services.ps1 update.txt imaservice
	-> checks the imaservice on all servers in update.txt
	-> creates StatusLog.csv with status of each servers imaservice service
